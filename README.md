Hello this is my first project on Arduino Ide - Bitcoin Puzzle

How To

1. Download Arduino IDE https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases
2. Run Arduino IDE Select your chip: ESP32 or any other.
3. In Arduino IDE, download and install the uBitcoin and ESPAsyncWebServer (from ESP32Async) library.
4. Replace the installed uBitcoin library with my uBitcoin.zip library (Documents\Arduino\libraries).
5. Once all the steps are completed, finally open your bitcoin_puzzle.ino source code in Arduino IDE and safely flash your selected device. ðŸš€

How to use the device after flashing:

1. Make sure your device is connected to power or a computer.
2. Now open Wi-Fi, find the BitcoinPuzzle access point, and connect to it using the default password BitPuzzle, unless you changed the access point and password in the source code.
3. Next open a browser and go to the address 192.168.4.1. You will land on a page where you can enter the ranges and the address you're looking for in the puzzle. After that, click Start, and your ESP32 will begin working:

4. Once the ESP32 finds the key, it will start blinking with a blue LED. If you see this blinking, go to the interface as described in step 3. There, you will see the key and the address. Good luck! =)
